# GoRently Portal: Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

This document outlines a detailed implementation plan for the GoRently Portal project. Every stage of this plan has been designed with the highest security standards and best practices in mind, incorporating principles such as Secure by Design, Least Privilege, and Defense in Depth.

---

## 1. Project Planning & Architecture

- **Requirements Analysis:**
  - Review technical and business requirements including Guesty API integration, Stripe payment processing, and Twilio notifications.
  - Confirm user roles and access permissions (admin, host, guest, property manager, concierge).

- **Architecture Design:**
  - Define a scalable microservices or modular architecture where the frontend (Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Typescript) and backend (Supabase, Clerk Auth) communicate via secure APIs.
  - Identify integration points with Guesty, Stripe, Twilio, and potential future AI enhancements (Open AI).
  - Document data flow diagrams to ensure sensitive information is encrypted in transit and at rest.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Establish secure defaults for all components.
  - Design role-based access control (RBAC) and implement strict session management using Clerk Auth.
  - Outline error handling and logging processes without disclosing sensitive information.

---

## 2. Environment Setup & Infrastructure

- **Development Environment:**
  - Set up local development and staging environments with isolated credentials and secure secret management (avoid hardcoding API keys).
  - Utilize lockfiles (package-lock.json or yarn.lock) to ensure deterministic builds and maintain dependency integrity.

- **Server & Deployment Configurations:**
  - Apply secure server configurations and harden the operating system as well as web servers.
  - Ensure HTTPS enforcement with TLS 1.2+ for all communications, especially API endpoints.
  - Configure security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, etc.).

- **Access Management:**
  - Implement least privilege for all services, especially database users on Supabase and Clerk Auth roles.

## 3. Frontend Development

- **User Interface Implementation:**
  - **Administrator Interface:**
    - Develop a responsive dashboard for subscriber management and activity monitoring with real-time analytics.
    - Integrate secure data access APIs to retrieve and manage platform data.

  - **Host Interface:**
    - **Online Check-In Form Builder:**
      - Use a drag-and-drop approach for building forms. Ensure input fields support validations (regex, conditional logic) and enforce secure processing of data uploaded (including file type and size validation).
    
    - **Customization Settings:**
      - Implement customizable branding (color palette: #2383f4, #2d323e, #1e232d, #f1f1f1 and fonts) to deliver a consistent look and feel.
    
    - **Guide Builder:**
      - Create an interface for hosts to build digital guides. Ensure rich text support with safe HTML output encoding to mitigate XSS.
    
    - **Upsell Services Management:**
      - Implement fixed upsells, request-based upsells, and custom request forms, ensuring robust validation and pricing adjustments.

  - **Guest Interface:**
    - Develop a guided and mobile-responsive online pre-check-in experience.
    - Integrate digital guide pages that generate a public property link with an auto-generated QR code.

- **Security Implementation in Frontend:**
  - Use Clerk Auth for robust user authentication and session management.
  - Apply client-side input validation but always enforce comprehensive server-side validations.
  - Set HTTPOnly, Secure, and SameSite attributes for cookies.

---

## 4. Backend Development & API Integrations

- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Integrate Clerk Auth securely for both frontend and backend, ensuring that session tokens are properly validated and that RBAC is enforced server-side.

- **Guesty API Integration:**
  - Implement a secure API connector to Guesty for real-time reservation data synchronization and custom field updates.
  - Validate data before updating Guesty custom fields, and log errors without exposing sensitive information during mismatches.
  - Observe API rate limits and implement exponential backoff/retry strategies in case of throttling.

- **Stripe Integration:**
  - Integrate Stripe for payment processing in a way similar to Stripe Connect, ensuring secure storage of tokens and applying proper commission deductions.
  - Use webhooks securely by verifying signatures and applying strict rate limiting.

- **Twilio Integration:**
  - Set up Twilio’s API for WhatsApp notifications while ensuring that all endpoints related to notifications are authenticated and secured.

- **Data Handling & Privacy:**
  - Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (using TLS) and at rest (using AES-256+).
  - Ensure that no sensitive data (e.g., API keys, payment details) is stored in plaintext.

- **Input Validation & Injection Prevention:**
  - Use parameterized queries and ORMs when interacting with the Supabase database.
  - Sanitize and validate all inputs from the forms and external APIs to prevent injection attacks.

---

## 5. Custom Field Mapping & Error Logging

- **Mapping Interface:**
  - Provide a user-friendly UI for hosts to map form fields to Guesty custom field IDs.
  - Validate mappings against an allow-list to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized API updates.

- **Error Logging & Notifications:**
  - Implement robust error logging for integration mismatches.
  - Log errors securely and notify relevant parties (via email/WhatsApp) using the notification panel in the host interface.

---

## 6. Real-Time Features & Responsive Design

- **Real-Time Data & Notifications:**
  - Implement WebSocket/Realtime functionality to ensure that reservation data and notifications update in real-time.
  - Manage notification thresholds to prevent spamming users.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Ensure all user interfaces are optimized for mobile and desktop devices with a focus on accessibility and responsiveness.

---

## 7. Testing, Security Review & Deployment

- **Comprehensive Testing:**
  - Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for each component using secure coding practices.
  - Test all input validations and API endpoints rigorously for injection, XSS, CSRF, and other common attacks.

- **Security Audit & Penetration Testing:**
  - Conduct a security audit and penetration tests based on the Defense in Depth principle. Review error handling and logging procedures to ensure no sensitive data leakage.

- **Deployment & Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):**
  - Secure the CI/CD pipeline—integrate static code analysis, dependency scanning, and vulnerability assessments (SCA) before deployments.
  - Disable debug features and verbose error messages in production.

---

## 8. Post-Deployment Monitoring & Maintenance

- **Monitoring & Alerting:**
  - Implement robust monitoring for API usage, error logs, and security events with tools like Prometheus or similar.
  - Ensure real-time alerts in case of unusual activity or integration issues.

- **Regular Updates & Dependencies Management:**
  - Schedule regular updates for dependencies, libraries, and security patches.
  - Use automated dependency tools to monitor for vulnerabilities.

- **User Feedback & Continuous Improvement:**
  - Collect user feedback continually to improve both functionality and security.

## Conclusion

This implementation plan not only addresses the functional requirements of the GoRently Portal but also embeds strong security practices at every stage of the development lifecycle. Each component is designed to restrict privileges, validate and sanitize inputs, and offer robust error handling and monitoring to ensure a secure, reliable, and seamless user experience.
