# GoRently App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a brand-new user first visits the GoRently Portal, they are greeted by a modern landing page that clearly communicates the benefits of the platform for short-term rental hosts. A clear call-to-action directs them to the registration page where they can create an account using either their email or a supported social login option. The user sees friendly messages prompting them to input basic information such as their name, email address, and to create a secure password. For added convenience, the application also supports a 'forgot password' workflow where users can request a password reset via an emailed link. This process guides them step by step to securely update their password and regain access to their account. Returning users can use the sign-in page, which is designed with clean interfaces and prompts for credentials, while also offering a persistent option to sign out when needed.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Once users log in, they are taken to their respective home pages that are tailored to their role on the platform. Administrators see a centralized dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of subscribers, real-time activity logs, and key performance metrics. The administrator interface is built with a minimalist and modern design that presents clear analytics and management panels for tracking user engagements and system health. Hosts, on the other hand, are taken to their dedicated host portal which serves as a control center for managing guest interactions. In this view, hosts are presented with intuitive navigation menus that include sidebars and headers which lead to sections such as the online check-in form builder, customization settings, guide builder, and upsell services. A consistent design language with the approved color palette and fonts ensures that the experience feels unified and professional across both administrator and host views.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
The GoRently Portal has been designed to handle the complete journey for each type of user. In the administrator flow, after signing in, the administrator is greeted with a dashboard that displays every subscriber and all related activity in real time. The screen transitions smoothly between overview panels and detailed logs, enabling admins to click into specific reports or user management sections without any friction. For hosts, upon logging in and connecting essential integrations like Guesty and Stripe, they can immediately begin customizing their interface from within the host portal. They start at a welcome page that explains each available module and then move into the Customization Settings where they can upload logos, select one of the predetermined color palettes, and apply the correct font choices such as Plus Jakarta Sans and Montserrat. The journey continues as hosts navigate to the Online Check-In Form Builder where they have the freedom to design a comprehensive pre-check-in form. This form builder allows them to add field types ranging from single choice and multiple choice options to text fields, numerical inputs, and file uploads. Each field option is equipped with advanced settings that let the host designate the input as mandatory or optional, and if a field should be applicable to every guest or reserved for the primary guest only. As the host completes their form, they can then move to the Guide Builder module. Here, hosts craft digital guides with rich media content that includes text, images, links, and even custom emojis and titles. The guide is previewed in real time and can be set up to appear both as an interactive guide for guests and a publicly accessible property page, often paired with a QR code for in-apartment use. Another key feature in the host flow is the Upsell Services Management module. In this section, hosts configure upsell options that fall into fixed services, request-based services, or custom upsell requests. The process is designed to allow hosts to adjust pricing even during the approval workflow before finalizing charges. When an upsell request is submitted by a guest, the host receives notifications via both email and WhatsApp (powered by Twilio) and can then approve, decline, or adjust the pricing accordingly. In addition, each module is deeply integrated with external systems; for instance, a form submission in the online check-in process maps selected fields to Guesty’s custom fields in real time while successful payment transactions trigger updates in Guesty to mark services as paid. The entire experience flows from one view to the next with intuitive navigation buttons and clear page transitions that help users understand where to go next at any point in their journey.

## Settings and Account Management
Users are provided with comprehensive settings and account management pages that allow them to update personal information, change passwords, and configure notifications. Hosts have additional settings sections where they can connect or update their Stripe account through a secure connection, similar to Stripe Connect, and input their Guesty Authentication Token to maintain real-time synchronization with the property management system. The settings include a user-friendly interface for managing advanced integrations, mapping custom form fields to corresponding Guesty custom field IDs, and adjusting preferences for receiving notifications via email or WhatsApp. Furthermore, hosts can manage team roles by adding users such as property managers or concierges, each with specific permission levels for accessing and managing listings. Once changes are saved, users can easily return to their main dashboard, ensuring that the updated settings are immediately reflected in the experience without interrupting the flow of their daily tasks.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
The application is designed with robustness in mind, acknowledging that errors or unexpected situations might occur. When users enter invalid data or encounter connectivity issues, the app displays clear, friendly error messages that provide actionable instructions to resolve the issue. If form submissions fail due to data mismatches – such as a field that does not align with the mapped Guesty custom fields – the error is logged in a dedicated notification panel accessible from within the host portal. Similarly, if the system detects any integration errors with external systems like Guesty or Stripe, the user is promptly alerted and guided through troubleshooting steps. In cases where a user attempts to access restricted areas due to insufficient permissions, a clear access-denied page is shown. These fallback pages all maintain the same modern design structure, ensuring that even error states are consistent and help the user regain their normal workflow quickly.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
The journey through the GoRently Portal is designed to be seamless and intuitive for administrators, hosts, and guests alike. It begins with a straightforward sign-up and sign-in process that incorporates modern authentication methods and clear password recovery options. Users then navigate to personalized dashboards that cater specifically to their roles – administrators manage the holistic view of user engagement and activity, whereas hosts have a complete suite of tools for managing guest experiences, from designing check-in forms to controlling upsell service workflows. The guest interface ensures that check-in and digital guide processes are both engaging and easy to navigate, whether accessed via a personalized link or a public QR code. With deep integrations that ensure real-time data synchronization, robust error handling, and comprehensive account management settings, the entire app flow is connected, clear, and built to streamline the management of short-term rental hosting. Every step, from onboarding to everyday operations, reinforces the platform’s commitment to modernity, responsiveness, and user-friendly design.
