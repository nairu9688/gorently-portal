# GoRently Portal - Tech Stack Document

This document explains, in everyday language, the technology choices for the GoRently Portal. The aim is to show how each technology plays a role in making the platform easy to use, secure, and scalable for everyone involved – whether you’re an administrator, host, or guest.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

The frontend is what users interact with directly, and we’ve chosen technologies that help create a modern and responsive experience. Here’s a breakdown:

- **Next.js**
  - A popular framework that makes building reactive web pages easy and fast.
  - Helps our application load quickly, ensuring a smooth experience whether on desktop or mobile.

- **Tailwind CSS**
  - A utility-first styling tool that allows us to design clean, modern interfaces quickly.
  - Enables highly customizable designs, such as matching the provided branding colors (#2383f4, #2d323e, #1e232d, #f1f1f1) and fonts (Plus Jakarta Sans, Montserrat).

- **Typescript**
  - Adds a layer of protection to our code by catching errors early.
  - Ensures more reliable and maintainable code for our interactive interfaces.

- **Shadcn UI**
  - A pre-built collection of user interface components that keep the design consistent throughout the app.
  - Helps speed up development while ensuring the look and feel meets modern usability standards.

- **Clerk Auth**
  - Provides secure user authentication to handle logins and user management effortlessly.
  - Ensures that only authorized users can access their respective admin, host, or guest portals.

These tools work together to provide an engaging, mobile-friendly, and accessible user experience that prioritizes speed and consistency.

## 2. Backend Technologies

The backend is all about data management, business logic, and integrations. It handles tasks behind the scenes to keep everything running smoothly:

- **Supabase**
  - Acts as our database and backend service. It stores all data securely and manages user information.
  - Provides built-in security features to protect sensitive information.

- **Clerk Auth**
  - While it also has a frontend component, it securely manages the login and user session details on the backend.
  
- **Open AI**
  - Supports any AI-powered features integrated into the platform for enhanced functionality and future expansion.

- **Guesty API**
  - Connects directly with the Guesty property management system (PMS).
  - Handles real-time data synchronization by importing and updating reservation data, ensuring that check-in forms and other custom fields are updated as needed.
  
- **Stripe**
  - Manages payment processing for upsell services, ensuring each transaction processes with a 2% commission fee.
  - Offers flexibility for pricing changes as required during the upsell approval workflow.

These technologies work behind the scenes to manage data, handle payments, and integrate with essential external systems in real time.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

Behind the scenes, our choices in deployment and infrastructure ensure that the application is reliable, scalable, and easy to update:

- **Hosting and Version Control**
  - The application is built on a robust structure (as seen with our CodeGuide Starter Pro), with a clear project structure that makes maintaining the code straightforward.
  - GitHub is used for version control, ensuring all changes are tracked and the team can work on improvements simultaneously.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**
  - Automated testing and deployment pipelines are in place to quickly roll out updates safely without downtime.

- **Developer Tools Integration**
  - **Lovable.dev**: Supports quick front-end and full-stack web app creation.
  - **Cursor**: An advanced IDE that provides real-time coding suggestions, making the development process faster and smoother.

These choices help reduce disruptions, ensure reliable performance, and allow the platform to scale as usage grows.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

To extend functionality without reinventing the wheel, the platform leverages key third-party services:

- **Stripe Integration**
  - Manages all payment processing with a built-in commission system.
  - Ensures trusted and secure handling of all financial transactions.

- **Twilio (WhatsApp Integration)**
  - Sends real-time notifications via WhatsApp (along with email notifications) for events like upsell requests and check-in activities.
  - Helps hosts stay connected with immediate alerts on key events.

- **Guesty API Integration**
  - Serves as the exclusive connector to the Guesty system, ensuring that all reservation data and custom field updates are synchronized in real time.
  - Logs any errors or mismatches in a notification panel to allow prompt troubleshooting.

These integrations allow us to provide a seamless, reliable, and feature-rich experience by connecting to trusted external services.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

Keeping user data secure and ensuring high performance is a top priority. Here’s how we tackle these challenges:

- **Security Measures**
  - **Supabase Security**: Ensures data is safely stored and accessed only by authorized users.
  - **Clerk Auth**: Provides a secure login system that protects user sessions.
  - Regular security audits and error logging (for instance, logging mismatches during Guesty API interactions) help maintain a secure environment.

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - **Next.js and Tailwind CSS**: Together, they produce fast-loading pages that are responsive and mobile-friendly.
  - Ensuring real-time data updates (e.g., with the Guesty API) means hosts and guests always see the most current information without delays.
  - Modern development practices, such as modular code and CI/CD pipelines, further improve reliability and speed.

These measures work together to keep the system fast, secure, and dependable while ensuring an excellent user experience.
